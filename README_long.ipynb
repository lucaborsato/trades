    "\n",
    "We have developed a computer program (in Fortran 90, openMP, and MPI) for determining \n",
    "the possible physical and dynamical configurations of extra-solar planetary \n",
    "systems from observational data, known as `TRADES`, which stands for TRAnsits and\n",
    "Dynamics of Exoplanetary Systems.  \n",
    "The program `TRADES` models the dynamics of multiple planet systems and\n",
    "reproduces the observed transit times ($T_{0}$, or mid-transit times),\n",
    "full transit durations ($T_{14}$ or $T_{41}$),\n",
    " and radial velocities (RVs).\n",
    "These $T_{0}\\textrm{s}$ and RVs are computed during the integration of the planetary orbits.  \n",
    "<!-- Hereafter, I will use the reduced chi-squared ($\\chi^{2}_\\textrm{r} = \\chi^{2}/\\textrm{dof}$)\n",
    "as the fitness parameter. -->\n",
    "<!-- , but it would be also possible to use a $\\chi^{2}_\\textrm{w,dof}$ weighted/scaled -->\n",
    "<!-- by the number of each type of data set: transits and radial velocities.   -->\n",
    "We have developed `TRADES` from scratch because we want to avoid black-box programs,\n",
    "it would be easier to parallelise it with openMP, and include additional algorithms.  \n",
    "To solve the inverse problem, `TRADES` can be run in different modes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **integration:**  \n",
    "  it runs a simple integration of the orbits of the planetary system calculating the $T_0$s and the RVs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **grid search:**  \n",
    "  TRADES samples the orbital elements of one perturbing body \n",
    "  (all the parameters are allowed in the grid, but remember that the number of simulations\n",
    "  will increase hugely).\n",
    "  The grid parameters can be evenly sampled on a fixed grid by setting\n",
    "  the number of steps, or the step size, or by a number of points\n",
    "  chosen randomly within the parameter bounds.\n",
    "  For any given set of values, the orbits are integrated, and the residuals\n",
    "  between the observed and computed $T_0$s and RVs are computed.\n",
    "  For each combination of the parameters, the `LM` algorithm can be called and\n",
    "  the best case is the one with the lowest residuals\n",
    "  (lowest reduced chi-squared = $\\chi^{2}/\\textrm{dof} = \\chi^{2}_\\textrm{r}$).  \n",

    "  After an initial guess on the orbital parameters of the perturber,\n",
    "  which could be provided by the previously described grid approach,\n",
    "  the LM algorithm exploits the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization method\n",
    "  to find the solution with the lowest residuals.\n",
    "  The LM algorithm requires the analytic derivative of the model with respect to\n",
    "  the parameters to be fitted.\n",
    "  Since the $T_0$s are determined by an iterative method and the\n",
    "  radial velocities are computed using the numerical integrator,\n",
    "  we cannot express these as analytic functions of fitting parameters.\n",
    "  We have adopted the method described in [Moré et al. (1980)][Moré1980]\n",

    "  The `epsfcn` parameter, which is the parameter that determines the first\n",

    "  that returns the lower $\\chi^2_\\textrm{r}$.\n",
    "  This method has the advantage to be scale invariant, but it assumes that\n",
    "  each parameter is varied by the same `epsfcn` value (e.g., a variation of\n",

    "  (e.g. Holland 1975; Goldberg 1989), where the fitness parameter was\n",
    "  the inverse of the $\\chi^2_\\textrm{r}$, now it is set to the log-likelihood ($\\log{\\mathcal{L}}$).\n",

    "  ranked following the fitness parameter. \n",
    "  A drawback of the `GA` is the slowness of the algorithm, when compared to other\n",
    "  optimizers.\n",
    "  However, the `GA` should converge to a global solution (if it exists)\n",
