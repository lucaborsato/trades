# priors of physical parameters
# label val -1sigma +1sigma
# possible label: mX, PX, eX, wX, mAX, iX, lNX, jitter_N, gamma_N, c_N
# X the id number of the body, where the first planet has X == 2, and last X = NB: X = 2, 3, 4, ..., NB
# mX : mass of planet X in Mearth!
# PX : period of planet X in days
# angles wX, mAX, iX, lNX in degree
# jitter_N in m/s, gamma_N in m/s, c_N between -1 and 1.
# example:
# m2 1.0 -0.3 +0.3
